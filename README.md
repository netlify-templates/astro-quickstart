## Quick Setup + Deploy Option

Click this button and it will help you create a new repo, create a new Netlify project, and deploy!

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/astro-quickstart)

## Regular Setup

 ### 1. Cloning + Install Packages

  - Clone this repo with one of these options:

    - Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the page
    - Or via the command line `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/astro-quickstart`

  - Then install the necessary packages and run the project locally to make sure everything works.

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

  > Alternatively, you can run this locally with [the Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)'s by running the `netlify dev` command for more options like receiving a live preview to share (`netlify dev --live`) and the ability to test [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions) and [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/). 

  ### 2. Deploying
  - Install the Netlify CLI globally `npm install netlify-cli -g`
    
  - Run `npm run build`

  - Then use the `netlify deploy` for a deploy preview link or `netlify deploy --prod` to deploy to production

  Here are a few other ways you can deploy this template:
    
  - Use the Netlify CLI's create from template command `netlify sites:create-template astro-quickstart` which will create a repo, Netlify project, and deploy it
    
  - If you want to utilize continuous deployment through GitHub webhooks, run the Netlify command `netlify init` to create a new project based on your repo or `netlify link` to connect your repo to an existing project

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── index.astro
│   └── style/
│       └── demo-styling.css
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Styling

We've added some modern styling to this template using css within an external stylesheet, this will allow you to easily remove our styling and add in your own. 

If you decide that you want to keep our styling you can review our style notes below. 

### Notes on Styling

The variables below give you the ability to change the gradient colors of the blobs and are interpolated into the URL string of the background-img within the body. 

```css
// Controls the blob blur gradient colors within the main tag's svg
--top-right-blur-1: #20C6B7;
--top-right-blur-2: #4D9ABF;
--bttm-left-blur-1: #FF5C02;
--bttm-left-blur-2: #FFCDB1;
```

### Remove Styling

If you decide that our styling is not for you, all you'll need to do is remove the [demo-styling.css](https://github.com/netlify-templates/astro-quickstart/tree/main/src/style/demo-styling.css) file. 


## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.

### Removing Cypress

For our testing, we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. This makes sure that we can validate that our templates are rendering and displaying as we’d expect. By default, we have Cypress not generate deploy links if our tests don’t pass. If you’d like to keep Cypress and still generate the deploy links, go into your `netlify.toml` and delete the plugin configuration lines:

```diff
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"
-  [plugins.inputs.postBuild]
-    enable = true
-
-  [plugins.inputs]
-    enable = false 
```

If you’d like to remove the `netlify-plugin-cypress` build plugin entirely, you’d need to delete the entire block above instead. And then make sure sure to remove the package from the dependencies using:

```bash
npm uninstall -D netlify-plugin-cypress
```

And lastly if you’d like to remove Cypress entirely, delete the entire `cypress` folder and the `cypress.config.ts` file. Then remove the dependency using:

```bash
npm uninstall cypress
```
